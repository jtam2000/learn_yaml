#
# Key Value pairs:
#

# aka scalar
key: value

# KV: strings for keys and values
simplekey: simplevalue

# KV: numeric keys and/or values
23: 45
100: "my age is"
spendmoney: 23.57

#
#String
#
# string can be placed in single or double quotes or no quotes
singlequote: 'single quote line'
doublequote: "double quotes iine"
no quotes: this line has quotes around it

# special characters must be in quotes
newlinechar: "this line has a end of line character \n"


# spaces are preserved even if you don't use quotes
stringLineWithSpaces: this line  has        spaces ....    .......       .....

# Multi-line string
# LEARNING: REMEMBER: "|" looks like stopping, ">" looks like continuing. | = "\n", > = " "
# "|" means concatenated all lines with "\n" after each line, except the last line
#
# this is called [Literal blocks]
multiline_ConcateateWithNewLine: |
  this is a multiple line
  here is line 2
  here is line3
# resulting value is:
# "this is a multiple line\nhere is line 2\nhere is line3"

# multi-line string: ">" means concatenate all the lines  with a space after each line, except last line
# this is called [folded] style
multiline_ConcateateNoNewLine: >
  this is a multiple line
  here is line 2
  here is line3
# result values is
# "this is a multiple line here is line 2 here is line3 then should appear as is"

# Usage of multi-line yml example: you can specify a shell script as an attribute for example
shellScriptOnOneLine:
  - bash
  - -c
  - |
    #!bin/bash -e
    echo "hello world" ${path}

#
#Comments
#
# comments are using the hash
# you can use it at any part of the KV
myage: 23.34    # this is a comment to the right of the KV


#
# Boolean
#
myboolean: false
myboolean2: true
YesAsTrue: yes   #translated to true
NoAsFalse: no    #translated to false

OnAsTrue: on    #translated to true
OffAsFalse: off    #translated to false

# Object blocks
#
MyObject:
  name: attribute 1
  server: attribute 2
  port: attribute 3

ObjectWithNull:
  name:       # value is null
  server:     # value is null
  port: 9000      # value is 900

# example usage of Blocks:
curl_command:
  command_name: curl
  command_arg:
    firstOption: -c
    descriptionMessage: "this is a curl command"
    sleep: 30   # sleep for 30 seconds

# output in json is this:
#  "curl_command": {
#    "command_arg": {
#      "descriptionMessage": "this is a curl command",
#      "firstOption": "-c",
#      "sleep": 30
#    },
#    "command_name": "curl"
#  }

# example usage of blocks: URL string interpolation can not be done in YML but you can provide
# the parts and let the application construct the full url
# this is good because the config should not have to know the logic to construct a url
# the config should just provide data, not logic(of constructing a full url)
machine: &DEFAULT_MACHINE 129.45.128.1
db: &DEFAULT_DB learnspring

url parts:       # application should use this object block to construct the full url
  mysqlroot:  jdbc:mysql://
  machine: *DEFAULT_MACHINE
  db: *DEFAULT_DB

#
# Lists
#



# LEARNING: the Dash Space is a List Block Indicator, so use it if you want to create a list
#     Remember: Dash is START OF AN ITEM ON A LIST, if you want another item, just start another dash space
#     so construct it like this:
#       - item1: item1 value
#       - item2: item2 value
#
#  LEARNING: all KVs' after start of a Dash Space: is an attribute of that ITEM
#         - itemAttribute1: itemAttribute1Value
#           itemAttribute2: itemAttribute2Value
#           itemAttribute3: itemAttribute3Value

# the above json is the same as this:
MyObject1:
  - name: attribute 1   #IMPORTANT:space needed after dash "-", the dash signal start of a list
    server: server1
    port: 1
                        # you can have blank lines as separators
  - name: attribute 1
    port: 2             #attributes not in same order as item 1
    server: server2

  - somethingdifferent: I can have different mixed attribute in list
    secondattribute: 3
# the above is equivalent to Json below:
#  {
#    "MyObject1": [       # notice the [ ] 's indicating a json list
#    {
#      "server": "server1",
#      "port": 1,
#      "name": "attribute 1"
#    },
#    {
#      "port": 2,
#      "name": "attribute 1",
#      "server": "server2"
#    },
#    {
#      "secondattribute": 3,
#      "somethingdifferent": "I can have different mixed attribute in list"
#    }
#    ]   #notice the closing "]"
#  }

#  sub-lists: 2 ways of using sub-lists
microservices:
  - name: name1
    server: server1
    port: [23, 34, 45]  # sub-list within microservices list

  - name: name2
    server: server1
    port:
      - 100            # another way to using sub-list
      - 200
      - 300

# List can be written in 3 days:
friends:
  - name: Ken  # method 1
    age: 50
  - {name: Daniel, age: 51}  # method 2, this seems to be good way to write compact lists for small # attributes

  -                 # Method 3
    name: yat
    age: 51
